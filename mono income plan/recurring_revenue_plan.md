# Mono Digital Marketing: Micro-Retainer Plan

**Target Pricing:** $30 / month per client
**Goal:** Reach $300/month recurring revenue by acquiring 10 clients on a highly automated, strictly bound "micro-retainer" service. 

At $30/month, your profit margin relies entirely on volume and automation. This is a "set it and forget it" model designed to keep clients in your ecosystem so you can upsell them later.

## The "Digital Foundation" Package ($30 / Month)

This package is for extremely budget-conscious local businesses or freelancers who want a bare-minimum baseline of online presence maintenance without thinking about it.

### Core Deliverables

#### 1. Google Business Profile (GBP) "Keep-Alive"
*   **Monthly Action:** 1 automated post to their Google Business Profile per month.
*   **Execution:** You batch-create 12 generic industry-specific posts at the start of the year and schedule them all via a free tool like Buffer or directly in GBP.
*   **Time Cost:** 30 minutes *per year* per client.

#### 2. Uptime Monitoring & Domain Renewal Reminders
*   **Monthly Action:** Automated pinging of their website to ensure it's online. If it goes down, they get an automated alert.
*   **Execution:** Use a free tool like UptimeRobot. Set up their email to receive alerts directly.

#### 3. Basic Monthly Snapshot (Automated)
*   **Deliverable:** An automated monthly email with 3 key numbers: Website Visitors, Google Profile Views, and Top Searching Keyword.
*   **Execution:** Google Analytics / Search Console automated email reports. No manual compilation required.

## Why This Plan Works (Your Strategy)

*   **Extreme Automation:** Service fulfillment for 10 clients should take absolutely no more than 1-2 hours per *month* combined. 
*   **Low Barrier to Entry:** Getting 10 clients to agree to $30/month ($360/year) is significantly easier than closing one $300/month client.
*   **The "Foot in the Door":** The real value of the $30/month plan is trust. When one of these 10 clients eventually needs a new website, a logo redesign, or a real marketing push, you are already their "web guy."

---

## Strict Boundaries (Crucial for $30/mo)

To remain profitable, you MUST strictly enforce the following:
*   **No Meetings:** No weekly or monthly check-in calls. Communication is strictly via email.
*   **No Custom Content:** You are not writing custom blogs or shooting localized video for $30/month.
*   **No Ad Management:** Paid ads demand daily monitoring, which this price point does not cover.
